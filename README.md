This project was part of my CS50 Web Programming course. 

## Functionality

Inspired by social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, this website has a news feed of posts, which authorized users can like/unlike. After registration and
logging in process, users can start following each other, visit each other's profiles, see how many followers other people have and ultimately unfollow each other if they'd
like.


#### This Project was written in VSCode using Django framework.
